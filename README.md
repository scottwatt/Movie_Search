# Movie-Search

For this project, we were tasked in making an application that uses at least two server-side APIs, use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap, use client-side storage to store persistant data, have a polished UI, have good quality coding standards, not use alerts, confirms, or prompts, deployed to GitHub Pages, and be interactive.

We decided to make an application that will allow the user to search for a movie, get the details of such movie and see if and where the movie is streaming online.

We used two server-side APIs, The Open Movie Database (OMDB) API and Streaming Availability API. The OMDB API was used to retrieve the movie information, such as the movie title, poster,  release date, genre, director and cast. Streaming Availability was used to retrieve the information of if the movie is streaming and on which stream site, if applicable.

The CSS framework used in this application is materializecss.
